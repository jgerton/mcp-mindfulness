## Test Setup Improvements

The test setup has been improved to properly handle database connections and server cleanup:

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Added proper connection handling in `test-db.ts` with connection options for stability
   - Ensured connections are properly closed after tests
   - Added delays to allow async operations to complete

2. **Server Cleanup**:
   - Added a `close` method to the `SocketManager` class to properly clean up socket connections
   - Enhanced the `closeServer` function to close both HTTP server and socket connections

3. **Test Configuration**:
   - Updated Jest configuration with better timeout settings
   - Added `detectOpenHandles` to identify resource leaks
   - Set `maxWorkers: 1` to run tests sequentially and avoid connection conflicts

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented standardized error handling with structured error responses
   - Created compatibility utilities to support test migration
   - Added comprehensive error code and category system
   - Provided migration guide for updating tests to use the new error format
   - See [Testing Standards](project-planning/standards/testing-standards.md#error-handling-in-tests) for more details

## MongoDB Testing Best Practices

Based on our experience resolving test timeout issues, we've established comprehensive best practices for MongoDB testing:

1. **Direct Controller Testing**:
   - Test controllers directly instead of through HTTP routes
   - Mock Express Request and Response objects
   - Eliminate network overhead and connection issues
   - See our [MongoDB Test Template](project-planning/guides/mongodb-test-template.md) for implementation

2. **Connection Management**:
   - Use a single connection per test suite with proper cleanup
   - Add explicit connection state logging for troubleshooting
   - Implement safeguards against race conditions

3. **Middleware Mocking**:
   - Mock authentication middleware to bypass token validation
   - Create streamlined request flow for controller testing
   - Ensure consistent test user identity

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use shorter timeouts (5-10s) for faster feedback
   - Create reusable test data generators
   - Reset database state between tests

For detailed guidelines, see our [MongoDB Connection Guide](project-planning/guides/mongodb-connection-guide.md) and [Testing Standards](project-planning/standards/testing-standards.md#mongodb-connection-management-for-tests).

## üîß Development

### Error Handling Guidelines

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy to ensure consistent error responses, appropriate logging, and a smooth user experience when issues occur.

#### Error Response Format

All API errors follow this standardized format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Technical error message",
    "category": "VALIDATION|SECURITY|BUSINESS|TECHNICAL",
    "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
    "requestId": "Request ID for tracing",
    "userMessage": "User-friendly message",
    "details": { 
      // Additional contextual information
    },
    "retryable": true|false
  }
}
```

#### Error Categories

Errors are categorized into four types:

- **VALIDATION**: User input or request format issues
- **SECURITY**: Authentication and authorization failures
- **BUSINESS**: Business logic violations or invalid operations
- **TECHNICAL**: System/infrastructure issues or unexpected errors

#### Best Practices

1. **Use AppError class**: Create errors with the `AppError` class to ensure proper categorization and severity.

```typescript
throw new AppError(
  'Resource not found',
  ErrorCodes.NOT_FOUND,
  ErrorCategory.BUSINESS
);
```

2. **Include Context**: Add relevant context to errors for debugging and logging.

```typescript
throw new AppError(
  'User profile update failed',
  ErrorCodes.DATABASE_ERROR,
  ErrorCategory.TECHNICAL,
  ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
  { userId: id, operation: 'update' }
);
```

3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Always provide clear, non-technical messages for end users.

4. **Logging Level Appropriateness**: Use the correct severity level for logging:
   - `ERROR`: Unexpected failures requiring attention
   - `WARNING`: Handled issues that might need investigation
   - `INFO`: Normal but notable events
   - `DEBUG`: Detailed development information

5. **Safe Error Details**: Never expose sensitive information in error responses.

6. **Retryable Indication**: Indicate if an operation can be retried successfully.

See `src/middleware/error-handler.middleware.ts` for implementation details.

### Export Functionality

The platform provides robust data export capabilities for users to download their data in multiple formats:

#### Supported Export Formats

- **JSON**: Structured data format ideal for programmatic access
- **CSV**: Tabular format compatible with spreadsheet applications

#### Exportable Data Types

- **User Data**: Basic profile information and settings
- **Achievements**: All user achievements with progress statistics
- **Meditations**: Complete meditation history with session details
- **Stress Assessments**: Historical stress level measurements

#### Export Security Features

- ObjectId validation for all requested resources
- Field-level permissions to protect sensitive data
- Export rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Data sanitization for privacy protection

#### Usage Example

```typescript
// Export user data in CSV format
const exportOptions = { 
  format: 'csv',
  dateRange: { 
    startDate: '2023-01-01', 
    endDate: '2023-12-31' 
  }
};
const userData = await exportService.getUserData(userId, exportOptions);
```

All export operations support date range filtering with both `startDate` and `endDate` parameters.
