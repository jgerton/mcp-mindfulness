## Test Setup Improvements

The test setup has been improved to properly handle database connections and server cleanup:

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Added proper connection handling in `test-db.ts` with connection options for stability
   - Ensured connections are properly closed after tests
   - Added delays to allow async operations to complete

2. **Server Cleanup**:
   - Added a `close` method to the `SocketManager` class to properly clean up socket connections
   - Enhanced the `closeServer` function to close both HTTP server and socket connections

3. **Test Configuration**:
   - Updated Jest configuration with better timeout settings
   - Added `detectOpenHandles` to identify resource leaks
   - Set `maxWorkers: 1` to run tests sequentially and avoid connection conflicts

4. **Index Management**:
   - Fixed duplicate index warnings by ensuring indexes are properly defined
   - Added clear comments to explain index patterns

These improvements help ensure tests run reliably and resources are properly cleaned up between tests.

## üîß Development

### Error Handling Guidelines

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy to ensure consistent error responses, appropriate logging, and a smooth user experience when issues occur.

#### Error Response Format

All API errors follow this standardized format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Technical error message",
    "category": "VALIDATION|SECURITY|BUSINESS|TECHNICAL",
    "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
    "requestId": "Request ID for tracing",
    "userMessage": "User-friendly message",
    "details": { 
      // Additional contextual information
    },
    "retryable": true|false
  }
}
```

#### Error Categories

Errors are categorized into four types:

- **VALIDATION**: User input or request format issues
- **SECURITY**: Authentication and authorization failures
- **BUSINESS**: Business logic violations or invalid operations
- **TECHNICAL**: System/infrastructure issues or unexpected errors

#### Best Practices

1. **Use AppError class**: Create errors with the `AppError` class to ensure proper categorization and severity.

```typescript
throw new AppError(
  'Resource not found',
  ErrorCodes.NOT_FOUND,
  ErrorCategory.BUSINESS
);
```

2. **Include Context**: Add relevant context to errors for debugging and logging.

```typescript
throw new AppError(
  'User profile update failed',
  ErrorCodes.DATABASE_ERROR,
  ErrorCategory.TECHNICAL,
  ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
  { userId: id, operation: 'update' }
);
```

3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Always provide clear, non-technical messages for end users.

4. **Logging Level Appropriateness**: Use the correct severity level for logging:
   - `ERROR`: Unexpected failures requiring attention
   - `WARNING`: Handled issues that might need investigation
   - `INFO`: Normal but notable events
   - `DEBUG`: Detailed development information

5. **Safe Error Details**: Never expose sensitive information in error responses.

6. **Retryable Indication**: Indicate if an operation can be retried successfully.

See `src/middleware/error-handler.middleware.ts` for implementation details.
