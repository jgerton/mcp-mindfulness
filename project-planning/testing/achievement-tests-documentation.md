# Achievement System Tests Documentation

## Overview
This document provides detailed information about the Achievement System tests in our codebase. These tests are currently skipped as the Achievement System is planned but not yet fully implemented.

## Test Categories

### 1. Time-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on the time of day when meditation sessions are completed.

#### Early Bird Achievement
```typescript
/**
 * @skipped
 * @reason Feature not yet implemented
 * 
 * @description
 * Tests that a user receives the "Early Bird" achievement after completing
 * a meditation session early in the morning (before 6 AM).
 * 
 * @functionality
 * Achievement System - Time-based achievements
 * 
 * @implementation-requirements
 * - Achievement model must be implemented
 * - Achievement service must include time-based tracking
 * - MeditationSession model must store accurate timestamps
 * - Early Bird achievement type must be defined
 * 
 * @related-issues
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Achievement System
 * 
 * @target-completion
 * Sprint 3
 */
it.skip('should award Early Bird achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### 2. Duration-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on the duration of meditation sessions.

#### Marathon Meditator Achievement
```typescript
/**
 * @skipped
 * @reason Feature not yet implemented
 * 
 * @description
 * Tests that a user receives the "Marathon Meditator" achievement after completing
 * a meditation session that lasts 30 minutes or longer.
 * 
 * @functionality
 * Achievement System - Duration-based achievements
 * 
 * @implementation-requirements
 * - Achievement model must be implemented
 * - Achievement service must track session durations
 * - MeditationSession model must accurately record duration
 * - Marathon Meditator achievement type must be defined
 * 
 * @related-issues
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Achievement System
 * 
 * @target-completion
 * Sprint 3
 */
it.skip('should award Marathon Meditator achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### 3. Streak-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on consistent meditation practice over time.

#### Week Warrior Achievement
```typescript
/**
 * @skipped
 * @reason Feature not yet implemented
 * 
 * @description
 * Tests that a user receives the "Week Warrior" achievement after completing
 * meditation sessions on 7 consecutive days.
 * 
 * @functionality
 * Achievement System - Streak-based achievements
 * 
 * @implementation-requirements
 * - Achievement model must be implemented
 * - Achievement service must track daily streaks
 * - MeditationSession model must store accurate dates
 * - Week Warrior achievement type must be defined
 * 
 * @related-issues
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Achievement System
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Streak Tracking
 * 
 * @target-completion
 * Sprint 4
 */
it.skip('should award Week Warrior achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### 4. Mood-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on mood improvements after meditation.

#### Mood Lifter Achievement
```typescript
/**
 * @skipped
 * @reason Feature not yet implemented
 * 
 * @description
 * Tests that a user receives the "Mood Lifter" achievement after completing
 * 10 meditation sessions that show mood improvement (from negative to positive).
 * 
 * @functionality
 * Achievement System - Mood-based achievements
 * 
 * @implementation-requirements
 * - Achievement model must be implemented
 * - Achievement service must track mood changes
 * - MeditationSession model must store mood before and after
 * - Mood Lifter achievement type must be defined
 * 
 * @related-issues
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Achievement System
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Mood Tracking
 * 
 * @target-completion
 * Sprint 4
 */
it.skip('should award Mood Lifter achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### 5. Progress-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on the number of completed meditation sessions.

#### Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Meditator Achievements
```typescript
/**
 * @skipped
 * @reason Feature not yet implemented
 * 
 * @description
 * Tests that a user receives progression-based achievements after completing
 * specific numbers of meditation sessions:
 * - Beginner: First session
 * - Intermediate: 10 sessions
 * - Advanced: 50 sessions
 * 
 * @functionality
 * Achievement System - Progress-based achievements
 * 
 * @implementation-requirements
 * - Achievement model must be implemented
 * - Achievement service must track session counts
 * - MeditationSession model must be linked to user
 * - Progression achievement types must be defined
 * 
 * @related-issues
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Achievement System
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement User Progress Tracking
 * 
 * @target-completion
 * Sprint 3
 */
it.skip('should award beginner achievement for first session', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

it.skip('should award intermediate achievement after 10 sessions', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

it.skip('should award advanced achievement after 50 sessions', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### 6. Points System
Tests that verify the points system associated with achievements.

#### Points Calculation
```typescript
/**
 * @skipped
 * @reason Feature not yet implemented
 * 
 * @description
 * Tests that the system correctly calculates and awards points
 * when users earn achievements.
 * 
 * @functionality
 * Achievement System - Points system
 * 
 * @implementation-requirements
 * - Achievement model must include points values
 * - UserPoints model must be implemented
 * - Achievement service must update points when achievements are earned
 * - Points calculation logic must be implemented
 * 
 * @related-issues
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Achievement System
 * - Issue #TBD: Implement Points System
 * 
 * @target-completion
 * Sprint 5
 */
it.skip('should calculate total points correctly', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

## Implementation Requirements

To implement the Achievement System and enable these tests, the following components need to be developed:

1. **Models**:
   - Achievement model with fields for type, progress, completion status, and points
   - UserPoints model to track total points and achievement history

2. **Services**:
   - AchievementService with methods for:
     - Initializing achievements for new users
     - Processing meditation sessions to award achievements
     - Calculating and updating user points
     - Retrieving user achievements and progress

3. **Integration Points**:
   - MeditationSession model needs to trigger achievement processing on completion
   - User model needs to be linked to achievements and points

4. **UI Components** (for future implementation):
   - Achievement display in user profile
   - Achievement notifications
   - Points leaderboard

## Prioritization

The recommended implementation order for the Achievement System is:

1. Core models and basic achievement types (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
2. Time-based and duration-based achievements
3. Streak-based achievements
4. Mood-based achievements
5. Points system and leaderboard
