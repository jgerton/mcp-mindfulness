# Testing Action Items

## Original Question

I think there are 2 action items regarding our tests and the work we have done to get them working as expected:

1. Can you review our work to fix the tests and see if there are lessons learned that would provide valuable updates to our documentation regarding testing practices, test design directions, code writing rules and standards?

2. Can we evaluate the 37 skipped tests to check if they add value and need to be unmarked as skipped or can they be considered unnecessary? Should any or all of them be included in the test suite? Should any or all of them be marked skipped with some comment lines explaining why they are skipped, in case they end up having value later?

## Response

### Action Item 1: Lessons Learned from Test Fixes

Our work fixing the tests has revealed several important lessons that should be documented in our testing standards:

<a id="error-response-consistency"></a>
#### 1. Error Response Consistency
- **Issue**: We found inconsistencies in error response formats (using `message` vs `error` properties)
- **Recommendation**: Add to testing standards that all API error responses should follow a consistent format with an `error` property containing the error message.

<a id="authentication-token-structure"></a>
#### 2. Authentication Token Structure
- **Issue**: Tests were failing due to inconsistent token structure in test cases
- **Recommendation**: Document that all test tokens should include both `_id` and `username` properties to match production requirements.

<a id="authorization-checks"></a>
#### 3. Authorization Checks
- **Issue**: We had to add proper authorization checks to prevent access to another user's sessions
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit guidance that all resource access should include ownership verification tests.

<a id="mongodb-connection-management"></a>
#### 4. MongoDB Connection Management
- **Issue**: Connection issues were causing test failures
- **Recommendation**: Enhance the database handling section to emphasize proper connection management using the in-memory MongoDB server.

<a id="objectid-validation"></a>
#### 5. ObjectId Validation
- **Issue**: Several tests failed due to improper ObjectId validation
- **Recommendation**: Add specific guidance on handling MongoDB ObjectId validation in controllers and tests.

<a id="error-status-code-standardization"></a>
#### 6. Error Status Code Standardization
- **Issue**: We had to standardize HTTP status codes for various error scenarios
- **Recommendation**: Document standard HTTP status codes for common error scenarios (404 for not found, 400 for validation errors, 401 for authentication errors, 403 for authorization errors).

<a id="action-item-2"></a>
### Action Item 2: Evaluation of Skipped Tests

After analyzing the 37 skipped tests, they can be categorized as follows:

<a id="achievement-system-tests"></a>
#### Achievement System Tests (25 tests)
- **Status**: The achievement system appears to be partially implemented
- **Context**: The implementation status document indicates the achievement system is marked as "Can be extended with" additional features
- **Recommendation**: Keep these tests skipped but add comments explaining they're for future implementation of the achievement system. The tests provide valuable documentation of intended behavior.

<a id="meditation-session-tests"></a>
#### Meditation Session Tests (12 tests)
- **Status**: These tests are for the MeditationSession model which appears to be in development
- **Context**: The implementation status document shows several meditation features as in progress
- **Recommendation**: Keep these tests skipped but add comments explaining they're for features that are planned but not yet fully implemented.

<a id="recommended-actions-skipped-tests"></a>
### Recommended Actions for Skipped Tests

1. **Add clear comments to each skipped test explaining**:
   - Why it's currently skipped
   - What functionality it's testing
   - What needs to be implemented before it can be unskipped

2. **Create a tracking issue** in your project management system to revisit these tests when the related features are implemented.

3. **Update the testing standards document** to include a section on "Test Lifecycle Management" that explains when and why tests might be skipped, and the process for reviewing and enabling them.

<a id="proposed-documentation-updates"></a>
## Proposed Documentation Updates

We recommend adding the following sections to your testing standards document:

<a id="error-response-standardization"></a>
### 1. Error Response Standardization
- All API error responses should use an `error` property for the error message
- Status codes should be consistent (404 for not found, 400 for validation errors, etc.)

<a id="authentication-testing"></a>
### 2. Authentication Testing
- Test tokens should include all required properties (`_id`, `username`)
- Tests should verify both successful authentication and failure cases

<a id="authorization-testing"></a>
### 3. Authorization Testing
- All resource access should include ownership verification tests
- Tests should verify that users cannot access resources they don't own

<a id="test-lifecycle-management"></a>
### 4. Test Lifecycle Management
- Guidelines for when to skip tests (e.g., planned but not implemented features)
- Process for documenting skipped tests with explanatory comments
- Schedule for reviewing skipped tests

<a id="mongodb-testing-best-practices"></a>
### 5. MongoDB Testing Best Practices
- Proper ObjectId validation and comparison
- Connection management with in-memory MongoDB
- Handling of database errors in tests
