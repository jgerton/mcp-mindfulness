## Review Process

### Pre-Review Preparation
1. **Test Inventory**: Generate a list of all skipped tests in the codebase
2. **Documentation Check**: Verify that all skipped tests have proper documentation
3. **Implementation Status**: Check the status of features related to skipped tests
4. **Roadmap Alignment**: Review the product roadmap for upcoming features

### Review Meeting Agenda
1. **Status Update** (15 minutes)
   - Overview of skipped tests
   - Changes since last review
   - Implementation progress

2. **Test-by-Test Review** (60 minutes)
   - Review each skipped test against criteria
   - Make decisions on each test
   - Assign action items

3. **Documentation Updates** (15 minutes)
   - Identify documentation that needs updating
   - Assign documentation tasks

4. **Next Steps** (15 minutes)
   - Summarize decisions
   - Set deadlines for action items
   - Plan for next review

### Post-Review Actions
1. **Update Documentation**: Update test documentation with review decisions
2. **Create Tickets**: Create implementation tickets for tests to be unskipped
3. **Update Comments**: Update test comments with latest status
4. **Report**: Generate a review summary report

## Criteria for Unskipping Tests

Tests should be unskipped when they meet the following criteria:

1. **Feature Implementation**: The feature being tested is fully implemented
2. **Dependencies**: All dependencies required by the test are available
3. **Relevance**: The test still provides value to the project
4. **Stability**: The test can run reliably without flakiness
5. **Maintenance**: The team has capacity to maintain the test

## Criteria for Removing Tests

Tests should be considered for removal when:

1. **Obsolescence**: The feature being tested is no longer part of the product
2. **Redundancy**: The test duplicates coverage provided by other tests
3. **Cost**: The maintenance cost outweighs the value provided
4. **Alternative**: A better testing approach has been implemented

## Documentation Requirements

For each skipped test, the following documentation must be maintained:

1. **Reason for Skipping**: Clear explanation of why the test is skipped
2. **Implementation Requirements**: What needs to be implemented before unskipping
3. **Target Completion**: When the test is expected to be unskipped
4. **Related Issues**: Links to relevant tickets or issues
5. **Last Review Date**: When the test was last reviewed
