# User and Authentication Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the User and Authentication tests in the MCP Mindfulness application. User management and authentication are critical components of the application, ensuring secure access to user data and personalized features.

## Test Status

The User and Authentication functionality is partially implemented. There are several skipped tests related to user management and authentication that need to be addressed in future sprints.

## Test Categories

The User and Authentication tests are organized into the following categories:

### 1. User Model Tests
Tests that verify the User model schema, validation, and methods.

### 2. Authentication Tests
Tests that verify the authentication process, including login, registration, and token validation.

### 3. Authorization Tests
Tests that verify that users can only access resources they are authorized to access.

### 4. Integration Tests
Tests that verify the integration of user and authentication functionality with other components of the application.

## Skipped Tests Documentation

The following tests are currently skipped because certain aspects of the User and Authentication functionality are still in development. Each test has been documented with standardized comments explaining why it's skipped, what functionality it's testing, and what needs to be implemented before it can be unskipped.

### User Model Tests

```typescript
// SKIPPED: User profile update functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can update their profile information
// Requirements: Implement user profile update functionality
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement user profile updates
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should update user profile information', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: User account deletion functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can delete their accounts
// Requirements: Implement user account deletion functionality
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement user account deletion
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should delete user account', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: User preferences functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can set and retrieve their preferences
// Requirements: Implement user preferences functionality
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement user preferences
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should set and retrieve user preferences', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Authentication Tests

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Password reset functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can reset their passwords
// Requirements: Implement password reset functionality
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement password reset
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should reset user password', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Email verification functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can verify their email addresses
// Requirements: Implement email verification functionality
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement email verification
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should verify user email', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: OAuth authentication not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can authenticate using OAuth providers
// Requirements: Implement OAuth authentication
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement OAuth authentication
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should authenticate user with OAuth', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Authorization Tests

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Role-based access control not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can only access resources based on their roles
// Requirements: Implement role-based access control
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement role-based access control
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should restrict access based on user role', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Resource ownership validation not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can only access resources they own
// Requirements: Implement resource ownership validation
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement resource ownership validation
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should restrict access to resources based on ownership', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

## Implementation Requirements

To implement the User and Authentication functionality and unskip these tests, the following components need to be developed or completed:

1. **User Model**
   - Implement profile update functionality
   - Implement account deletion functionality
   - Implement user preferences functionality

2. **Authentication Service**
   - Implement password reset functionality
   - Implement email verification functionality
   - Implement OAuth authentication

3. **Authorization Service**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Implement resource ownership validation

4. **Integration with Other Services**
   - Email Service integration for password reset and email verification
   - OAuth Provider integration for third-party authentication

## Test Implementation Plan

The User and Authentication tests will be implemented in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Complete the user model implementation
- Implement basic authentication functionality
- Unskip and fix user model validation tests

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Implement password reset functionality
- Implement email verification functionality
- Implement user preferences functionality
- Unskip and fix authentication tests

### Phase 3: Authorization
- Implement role-based access control
- Implement resource ownership validation
- Unskip and fix authorization tests

## Dependencies

The User and Authentication tests have dependencies on the following components:

- MongoDB for user data storage
- JWT for token generation and validation
- Email service for password reset and email verification
- OAuth providers for third-party authentication

## Conclusion

The User and Authentication tests provide valuable documentation of the intended behavior of the user management and authentication functionality. While currently skipped, they serve as a roadmap for implementing these features in future sprints. Once the User and Authentication functionality is fully implemented, these tests will ensure that it functions correctly and provides users with a secure and personalized experience.
