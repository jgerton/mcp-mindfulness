# Meditation Session Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the Meditation Session tests in the MCP Mindfulness application. The Meditation Session functionality is a core component of the application, allowing users to start, track, and complete meditation sessions, as well as record their mood and focus metrics.

## Test Status

The Meditation Session functionality is currently in development. There are 12 skipped tests related to Meditation Sessions, which are intended to verify the functionality once it is fully implemented.

## Test Categories

The Meditation Session tests are organized into the following categories:

### 1. Model Tests
Tests that verify the Meditation Session model schema, validation, and methods.

### 2. Service Tests
Tests that verify the Meditation Session service functionality for creating, updating, and completing sessions.

### 3. Analytics Tests
Tests that verify the analytics functionality related to meditation sessions, such as tracking mood changes and session statistics.

## Skipped Tests Documentation

The following tests are currently skipped because certain aspects of the Meditation Session functionality are still in development. Each test has been documented with standardized comments explaining why it's skipped, what functionality it's testing, and what needs to be implemented before it can be unskipped.

### Model Tests

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Meditation session model is being refactored
// Description: Verifies that the meditation session model validates all required fields
// Requirements: Complete the refactoring of the meditation session model
// Related Issue: #TBD - Refactor meditation session model
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
describe.skip('MeditationSession', () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Streak calculation functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that the meditation session model correctly calculates and updates streak information
// Requirements: Implement streak calculation logic in the meditation session model
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement meditation streaks
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should update user streak when session is completed', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Focus rating analytics not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that the meditation session model correctly validates and processes focus rating data
// Requirements: Implement focus rating analytics in the meditation session model
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement focus rating analytics
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should calculate average focus rating', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Service Tests

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Session resumption functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can resume an interrupted meditation session
// Requirements: Implement session resumption logic in the meditation session service
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement session resumption
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should resume an interrupted session', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Session scheduling functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users can schedule meditation sessions for future dates
// Requirements: Implement session scheduling in the meditation session service
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement session scheduling
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should schedule a future session', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Session recommendation functionality not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that the system recommends appropriate meditation sessions based on user history
// Requirements: Implement session recommendation logic in the meditation session service
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement session recommendations
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should recommend sessions based on user history', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Analytics Tests

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Mood tracking analytics not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that the system correctly tracks and analyzes mood changes before and after meditation sessions
// Requirements: Implement mood tracking analytics in the session analytics service
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement mood tracking analytics
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should track mood improvements over time', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Session duration analytics not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that the system correctly analyzes session duration patterns
// Requirements: Implement session duration analytics in the session analytics service
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement session duration analytics
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should analyze session duration patterns', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Interruption analytics not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that the system correctly tracks and analyzes session interruptions
// Requirements: Implement interruption analytics in the session analytics service
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement interruption analytics
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should track interruption patterns', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

## Implementation Requirements

To implement the Meditation Session functionality and unskip these tests, the following components need to be developed or completed:

1. **Meditation Session Model**
   - Complete schema refactoring
   - Implement streak calculation logic
   - Implement focus rating validation and processing

2. **Meditation Session Service**
   - Implement session resumption logic
   - Implement session scheduling functionality
   - Implement session recommendation algorithm

3. **Session Analytics Service**
   - Implement mood tracking analytics
   - Implement session duration analytics
   - Implement interruption analytics

4. **Integration with Other Services**
   - User Service integration for streak tracking
   - Achievement Service integration for awarding achievements
   - Notification Service integration for session reminders

## Test Implementation Plan

The Meditation Session tests will be implemented in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Complete the meditation session model refactoring
- Implement basic session CRUD operations
- Unskip and fix model validation tests

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Implement streak calculation
- Implement session resumption
- Implement session scheduling
- Unskip and fix service functionality tests

### Phase 3: Analytics
- Implement mood tracking analytics
- Implement session duration analytics
- Implement interruption analytics
- Unskip and fix analytics tests

## Dependencies

The Meditation Session tests have dependencies on the following components:

- User Model
- Meditation Model
- Base Wellness Session Model
- Session Analytics Model
- Achievement Service (for awarding achievements)

## Conclusion

The Meditation Session tests provide valuable documentation of the intended behavior of the meditation session functionality. While currently skipped, they serve as a roadmap for implementing this feature in future sprints. Once the Meditation Session functionality is fully implemented, these tests will ensure that it functions correctly and provides users with the expected experience.
