# Achievement System Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the Achievement System tests in the MCP Mindfulness application. The Achievement System is designed to reward users for various accomplishments in their mindfulness journey, such as completing meditation sessions, maintaining streaks, and reaching milestones.

## Test Status

The Achievement System is currently partially implemented. There are 25 skipped tests related to the Achievement System, which are intended to verify the functionality once it is fully implemented.

## Test Categories

The Achievement System tests are organized into the following categories:

### 1. Time-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on the time of day when meditation sessions are completed.

### 2. Duration-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on the duration of meditation sessions.

### 3. Streak-based Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded based on maintaining consistent meditation practice over time.

### 4. Milestone Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded for reaching specific milestones in the user's meditation journey.

### 5. Special Achievements
Tests that verify achievements awarded for special accomplishments or unique meditation patterns.

## Skipped Tests Documentation

The following tests are currently skipped because the Achievement System is not fully implemented. Each test has been documented with standardized comments explaining why it's skipped, what functionality it's testing, and what needs to be implemented before it can be unskipped.

### Time-based Achievements

// Requirements: AchievementService needs to implement streak tracking and streak-based achievement checks
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement achievement system
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should award Monthly Master achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Milestone Achievements

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Achievement system not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users receive the First Steps achievement when completing their first meditation session
// Requirements: AchievementService needs to implement milestone tracking and milestone-based achievement checks
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement achievement system
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should award First Steps achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Achievement system not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users receive the Century Club achievement when completing 100 meditation sessions
// Requirements: AchievementService needs to implement milestone tracking and milestone-based achievement checks
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement achievement system
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should award Century Club achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Special Achievements

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Achievement system not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users receive the Variety Seeker achievement when completing different types of meditation sessions
// Requirements: AchievementService needs to implement special achievement checks
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement achievement system
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should award Variety Seeker achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// SKIPPED: Achievement system not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that users receive the Mood Improver achievement when reporting significant mood improvement after sessions
// Requirements: AchievementService needs to implement mood tracking and special achievement checks
// Related Issue: #TBD - Implement achievement system
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should award Mood Improver achievement', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

## Implementation Requirements

To implement the Achievement System and unskip these tests, the following components need to be developed:

1. **Achievement Service**
   - Time-based achievement checks
   - Duration-based achievement checks
   - Streak tracking and streak-based achievement checks
   - Milestone tracking and milestone-based achievement checks
   - Special achievement checks

2. **Achievement Models**
   - Achievement definitions
   - User achievement progress tracking
   - Achievement completion status

3. **Achievement Controllers**
   - Endpoints for retrieving user achievements
   - Endpoints for claiming achievement rewards

4. **Integration with Other Services**
   - Meditation Session Service integration
   - User Service integration
   - Points/Rewards System integration

## Test Implementation Plan

The Achievement System tests will be implemented in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core Achievement System
- Implement basic achievement models and service
- Implement achievement initialization for new users
- Implement achievement progress tracking
- Unskip and fix basic achievement tests

### Phase 2: Achievement Categories
- Implement time-based achievements
- Implement duration-based achievements
- Implement streak-based achievements
- Unskip and fix category-specific tests

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Implement milestone achievements
- Implement special achievements
- Implement achievement rewards
- Unskip and fix remaining tests

## Dependencies

The Achievement System tests have dependencies on the following components:

- User Model
- Meditation Model
- Meditation Session Model
- User Points Model (for rewards)

## Conclusion

The Achievement System tests provide valuable documentation of the intended behavior of the achievement system. While currently skipped, they serve as a roadmap for implementing this feature in future sprints. Once the Achievement System is fully implemented, these tests will ensure that it functions correctly and provides users with the expected rewards for their mindfulness practice.
