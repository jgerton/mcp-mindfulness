## Implementation Requirements

To implement the Achievement System and enable these tests, the following components need to be developed:

### 1. Achievement Model and Schema
```typescript
interface Achievement {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'time' | 'duration' | 'streak' | 'milestone' | 'special';
  criteria: {
    type: string;
    value: any;
  };
  icon: string;
  points: number;
}

interface UserAchievement {
  userId: string;
  achievementId: string;
  dateEarned: Date;
  progress: number;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Achievement Service
```typescript
class AchievementService {
  // Core methods
  initializeUserAchievements(userId: string): Promise<void>;
  getAchievements(): Promise<Achievement[]>;
  getUserAchievements(userId: string): Promise<UserAchievement[]>;
  
  // Achievement processing
  processUserActivity(userId: string, activity: any): Promise<UserAchievement[]>;
  checkTimeBasedAchievements(userId: string, session: MeditationSession): Promise<UserAchievement[]>;
  checkDurationBasedAchievements(userId: string, session: MeditationSession): Promise<UserAchievement[]>;
  checkStreakAchievements(userId: string): Promise<UserAchievement[]>;
  checkMilestoneAchievements(userId: string): Promise<UserAchievement[]>;
  checkSpecialAchievements(userId: string, data: any): Promise<UserAchievement[]>;
  
  // Progress tracking
  updateAchievementProgress(userId: string, achievementId: string, progress: number): Promise<UserAchievement>;
  completeAchievement(userId: string, achievementId: string): Promise<UserAchievement>;
}
```

### 3. Achievement API Endpoints
```typescript
// GET /api/achievements
// GET /api/users/:userId/achievements
// POST /api/users/:userId/achievements/:achievementId/claim
```

### 4. Integration with Other Services
- Meditation Session Service integration
- User Service integration
- Points/Rewards System integration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Achievement System (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Implement Achievement model and schema
- [ ] Implement UserAchievement model and schema
- [ ] Create basic AchievementService with core methods
- [ ] Implement achievement initialization for new users
- [ ] Create API endpoints for retrieving achievements

### Phase 2: Achievement Processing (Days 4-7)
- [ ] Implement time-based achievement processing
- [ ] Implement duration-based achievement processing
- [ ] Implement streak tracking and achievement processing
- [ ] Implement milestone tracking and achievement processing
- [ ] Implement special achievement processing

### Phase 3: Testing and Integration (Days 8-10)
- [ ] Enable and fix time-based achievement tests
- [ ] Enable and fix duration-based achievement tests
- [ ] Enable and fix streak-based achievement tests
- [ ] Enable and fix milestone achievement tests
- [ ] Enable and fix special achievement tests

## Dependencies

The Achievement System implementation has dependencies on the following components:

- User Model and Service
- Meditation Session Model and Service
- User Points/Rewards System (if applicable)

## Success Criteria

- All 25 skipped tests are enabled and passing
- Achievement System is fully integrated with other services
- Users can earn and view their achievements
- Achievement progress is tracked accurately

## Progress Tracking

| Category | Tests Enabled | Tests Passing | Implementation Status |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Time-based | 0/5 | 0/5 | Not started |
| Duration-based | 0/5 | 0/5 | Not started |
| Streak-based | 0/5 | 0/5 | Not started |
| Milestone | 0/5 | 0/5 | Not started |
| Special | 0/5 | 0/5 | Not started |
| **Total** | **0/25** | **0/25** | **Not started** |

## Notes

- The Achievement System is a core feature for Sprint Three
- All tests should follow the updated testing standards
- Error handling should follow the standardized error response format
- Authentication and authorization must be properly implemented for all endpoints
