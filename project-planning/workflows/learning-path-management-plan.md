# Learning Path Management Plan

[← Back to Main README](../README.md)

## What is Learning Path Management?

Learning path management is the systematic approach to organizing and delivering educational content in a way that optimizes user progress and engagement. In our context, it involves:
- Structuring stress management and mindfulness content
- Creating progressive skill development paths
- Adapting content to individual learning styles
- Tracking and supporting user progress

This plan is crucial because it helps us:
- Create effective learning experiences
- Personalize content delivery
- Maintain user engagement
- Measure and improve learning outcomes
