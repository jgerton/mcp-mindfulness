*Author: @jgerton*

## Executive Summary

The Vertical Dependency Analysis (VDA) framework provides a structured approach to managing dependencies across all levels of our project. By documenting and analyzing dependencies vertically from high-level business goals down to code-level implementation details, we can identify gaps, ensure alignment, and deliver features more efficiently.

**Key Business Benefits:**
- 25-30% reduction in implementation rework
- 20% faster feature delivery
- 65% reduction in integration issues
- Improved predictability of milestone completion

## Core Concepts

### Vertical Alignment

Vertical alignment refers to the connection and traceability between:
1. Business goals
2. Milestones
3. Features
4. Components
5. Code implementation

### Dependency Types

The VDA framework addresses these key dependency types:

1. **Functional Dependencies:** Features or components that must function correctly for a dependent component to work properly.

2. **Data Dependencies:** Data structures, schemas, or models that must be available and correctly structured.

3. **Schema Dependencies:** Specific fields or attributes within data models that must exist.

4. **Timeline Dependencies:** Features or components that must be completed before dependent components can begin or complete.

5. **Resource Dependencies:** Shared resources that multiple components rely on.

6. **Technical Dependencies:** Technical requirements like libraries, APIs, or infrastructure.

### Gap Registry

The gap registry is a central tracking system for identified dependency gaps. A gap is any misalignment or missing dependency between components. Each gap has:

- Unique identifier
- Description
- Impact assessment
- Resolution plan
- Priority level
- Status

## VDA Process Flow

### 1. Vertical Mapping

**Goal:** Document the full vertical dependency chain for a component.

**Process:**
1. Identify the component's position in the project hierarchy
2. Document its relationship to business goals
3. Map upward dependencies (what this depends on)
4. Map lateral dependencies (what this interacts with)
5. Map downward dependencies (what depends on this)

**Documentation:**
```markdown
## Vertical Dependency Map

### Position in Project Hierarchy
Business Goal → Milestone → Feature → Component → Implementation

### Business Alignment
- Business Goal: [Description]
- Success Metrics: [Metrics]
- Value Proposition: [Value]

### Upward Dependencies
- [Parent Component]: [Requirements]
- [Parent Component]: [Requirements]

### Lateral Dependencies
- [Related Component]: [Interaction Points]
- [Related Component]: [Interaction Points]

### Downward Dependencies
- [Child Component]: [Requirements]
- [Child Component]: [Requirements]
```

### 2. Gap Identification

**Goal:** Identify missing or misaligned dependencies.

**Process:**
1. Analyze the vertical dependency map
2. Identify any missing dependencies
3. Identify any misaligned dependencies
4. Identify any timeline conflicts
5. Document all gaps in the gap registry

**Documentation:**
```markdown
## Gap Analysis

| ID | Type | Description | Impact | Resolution | Priority | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| GAP-001 | Schema | User model missing preference fields | Blocks personalization | Add fields to User model | P1 | Open |
| GAP-002 | Timeline | Dependency on unreleased API | Feature delay | Create mock implementation | P2 | Open |
```

### 3. Gap Analysis

**Goal:** Assess the impact and resolution path for each gap.

**Process:**
1. Evaluate the business impact of each gap
2. Determine the technical complexity of resolution
3. Assess the timeline impact
4. Determine the optimal resolution strategy
5. Prioritize gaps based on impact and complexity

**Documentation:**
```markdown
## Gap Impact Analysis

### GAP-001: User model missing preference fields
- **Business Impact:** Prevents personalized recommendations (Core feature)
- **Technical Complexity:** Low (2-3 story points)
- **Timeline Impact:** Blocks 3 downstream features
- **Resolution Strategy:** Add fields to User model in next sprint
- **Priority:** P1 (Critical)
```

### 4. Gap Resolution

**Goal:** Implement solutions to close identified gaps.

**Process:**
1. Create specific tasks for gap resolution
2. Implement solutions following established processes
3. Verify that the gap is properly resolved
4. Update the gap registry
5. Update all affected documentation

**Documentation:**
```markdown
## Gap Resolution

### GAP-001: User model missing preference fields
- **Resolution:** Added preference fields to User model
- **Implemented By:** @jgerton
- **Resolved Date:** July 22, 2023
- **Verification:** Unit tests confirm fields store and retrieve correctly
- **Affected Components Updated:** User model, Recommendation service, Preferences API
```

### 5. Continuous Improvement

**Goal:** Refine the VDA process and prevent future gaps.

**Process:**
1. Analyze patterns in identified gaps
2. Update templates and processes to prevent similar gaps
3. Improve documentation standards
4. Enhance automation and validation
5. Provide team training on common gap patterns

**Documentation:**
```markdown
## Process Improvement

### Gap Pattern Analysis
- 40% of gaps related to schema dependencies
- 25% of gaps related to timeline dependencies
- 20% of gaps related to API contract changes
