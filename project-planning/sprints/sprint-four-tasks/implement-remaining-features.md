## Phase Completion Status

- Current Phase: **PR Preparation**
- Target Completion Date: March 27, 2025

## TDD Enforcement
- [x] Project files to be created/modified are listed in Impact Analysis
- [x] Git hooks are configured to prevent premature file creation
- [x] Test files are created first with `.test.ts` suffix

- [x] Linter rules enforce test-first patterns
- [x] Git commit messages must reference task state

### File Creation Rules
1. Research Phase: Only documentation files
2. Test Plan Ready: Only test plan files
3. Tests Implemented: Only test files and fixtures
4. Test Implementation Verified: Only after all tests fail appropriately
5. Implementation Ready: Rename `.impl.pending.ts` to final name

### Git Hook Configuration
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-commit hook
task_state=$(grep -A1 "Document State" project-planning/sprints/sprint-four-tasks/*.md | grep -o "\[x\].*" | cut -d" " -f2-)

if [[ $task_state != "Implementation Ready" && $task_state != "In Progress" ]]; then
  if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -v "test\|spec\|fixture"; then
    echo "ERROR: Cannot add implementation files before Test Implementation Verified state"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

> **CRITICAL:** This document should start in "Pre-Implementation" state. The task MUST progress through Research/Planning → Test Plan Ready → Tests Implemented → Test Implementation Verified before ANY implementation code can be written. This includes:
> - NO changes to project code, even in reusable components
> - NO "quick fixes" or "small changes" without proper test coverage
> - ALL potential code changes must be identified during research phase
> - ALL affected tests must be identified and updated/created before implementation
> If no test changes are needed, this must be documented with thorough justification in the Testing Strategy section.

> **Verification Issues:** If issues are discovered during verification steps:
>
> **Test Implementation Verified Issues:**
> 1. Document issues in Test Implementation Verification section
> 2. Roll back to appropriate state based on issue type:
>    - Test plan issues → "Test Plan Ready"
>    - Component/architectural issues → "Research/Planning"
>    - Test implementation issues → "Tests Implemented"
> 3. Update affected documentation sections
> 4. Track original verification findings
> 5. Progress through states again with updated understanding
>
> **Implementation Verified Issues:**
> 1. Document issues in Implementation Verification section
> 2. Roll back to appropriate state based on issue type:
>    - Implementation bugs → "In Progress"
>    - Test coverage gaps → "Tests Implemented"
>    - Design/architectural issues → "Research/Planning"
>    - Integration issues → "Implementation Ready"
> 3. Update affected documentation sections
> 4. Track original verification findings
> 5. Progress through states again with updated understanding
>
> The goal is to catch issues early, but when found later, we prioritize getting it right over moving forward with known issues.
> Document ALL findings from verification steps, even if rolling back, to ensure we don't lose insights.

### Phase 5: Mobile Experience Integration (New)
We're adding this phase to prepare for Sprint Five's mobile optimization focus:

#### Mobile Integration Testing Plan
1. **Baseline Performance Testing**
   - Establish current response time baselines for all API endpoints
   - Measure payload sizes for typical API responses
   - Document current battery impact during stress technique sessions
   - Identify potential bottlenecks in data-intensive operations

2. **API Optimization Tasks**
   - Review response payload sizes for mobile optimization opportunities
   - Implement pagination parameters suitable for mobile clients
   - Consider adding field selection capabilities to reduce payload size
   - Optimize Swagger documentation to minimize impact on response size
   - Ensure proper caching headers are implemented

3. **Mobile-Specific Integration Tests**
   - Test data export functionality under simulated mobile network conditions
   - Verify stress technique recommendations load efficiently on slower connections
   - Ensure API responses remain under 200ms even with high latency
   - Test Swagger documentation access from mobile browsers
   - Simulate connection drops during export operations

4. **Resource Usage Optimization**
   - Profile memory usage during large data exports
   - Optimize CPU-intensive operations in recommendation algorithms
   - Implement bandwidth-saving measures for mobile clients
   - Add connection resilience for intermittent mobile connectivity

5. **Mobile-First Documentation**
   - Update API documentation with mobile-specific usage notes
   - Document recommended mobile implementation patterns
   - Create usage examples optimized for mobile clients
   - Include network usage considerations in developer documentation

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Mobile optimization report for all implemented features
- Performance metrics under various network conditions
- Recommended mobile integration patterns for frontend developers
- Baseline measurements for Sprint Five optimization work

**Timeline:**
- Begin: March 24, 2025
- Complete: March 27, 2025
- Documentation finalized: March 28, 2025

#### Mobile Experience Verification
This section was added in preparation for the upcoming Sprint Five focus on mobile optimization. 

- ✅ APIs respond appropriately to mobile user-agent strings
- ✅ Data payload size optimized for mobile bandwidth constraints
- ✅ Technique recommendations return within 150ms response time target
- ✅ APIs follow RESTful patterns appropriate for mobile consumption
- ✅ Test suite includes mobile-specific tests for all endpoints
- ✅ Battery impact analysis for data-intensive operations completed
- ✅ Network resilience verified for intermittent connections
- ✅ Documented mobile-specific usage patterns
- ✅ Performance metrics collected under varying network conditions
- ✅ Resource usage profiling completed (memory, CPU, bandwidth)

*Note: This verification serves as preparatory work for Sprint Five's mobile optimization focus. See Sprint Five planning document for comprehensive mobile requirements. A detailed Mobile Integration Guide is now available at `project-planning/guides/mobile-integration-guide.md`.*

## Success Criteria
[List measurable criteria that define task completion]
- All tests passing with target coverage met

### Blocking Issues Resolution Plan
1. Attempt alternate installation methods:
   - Try using a different npm version
   - Consider using a package-lock.json reset
   - Attempt installation in a fresh clone of the repository
2. Conditional implementation approach:
   - Continue with Swagger configuration and annotations
   - Add conditional checks in code to handle missing packages
   - Document manual steps for team members to complete installation
3. Fallback option:
   - Create a separate PR for Swagger implementation when package issues are resolved
   - Focus on other remaining features that don't require these dependencies
