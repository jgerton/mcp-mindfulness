# Sprint Four: Stress Management Techniques and Data Export

## Summary of Changes

This PR completes the implementation of two major features from Sprint Four:

1. **Stress Management Techniques**: A comprehensive library of evidence-based stress reduction techniques with intelligent recommendations based on user stress levels and available time.

2. **Data Export API**: Flexible data export functionality allowing users to export their wellness data in multiple formats (JSON, CSV) with filtering options.

3. **Swagger API Documentation**: Complete API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI, making all endpoints discoverable and testable.

4. **Mobile Experience Optimizations**: Extensive mobile-specific optimizations including network resilience, battery impact reduction, and data usage efficiency.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Complete test coverage for all new models, services, and controllers
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests for all new API endpoints
- **Mobile-Specific Tests**: 
  - Network resilience tests simulating flaky connections
  - Performance tests verifying sub-150ms response times for critical endpoints
  - Battery impact analysis through the `battery-impact-test.js` script

All tests are passing with the following command:
```
npm test
```

Mobile-specific tests can be run with:
```
npm run test:mobile
```

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been created/updated:

- **New Guides**:
