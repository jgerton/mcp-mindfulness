# Sprint Three: Backend Feature Implementation

## Sprint Goals
- Implement core features identified in skipped tests
- Begin integration of stress management functionality
- Develop backend API endpoints for all core features
- Establish data models and service architecture
- Incorporate testing best practices from TODO-TESTING.md
- Integrate the MockArchitect testing system into our testing approach

## Sprint Duration
- Start Date: June 12, 2023
- End Date: June 26, 2023
- Duration: 2 weeks

## Implementation Structure
All implementation code should be placed in the appropriate directories under `/src` and should use TypeScript (`.ts` extension):

### Core Directories
- Models: `/src/models/` - Database schemas and models
- Controllers: `/src/controllers/` - Request handlers and business logic
- Routes: `/src/routes/` - API endpoint definitions
- Services: `/src/services/` - Reusable business logic and third-party integrations
- Middleware: `/src/middleware/` - Request processing middleware
- Validations: `/src/validations/` - Input validation logic
- Utils: `/src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- Socket: `/src/socket/` - WebSocket implementation
- Components: `/src/components/` - Reusable components
- Config: `/src/config/` - Configuration settings
- Tests: `/src/__tests__/` - Test files

### Core Files
- `app.ts` - Express application setup (not `app.js`)
- `config.ts` - Configuration variables (not `config.js`)
- `index.ts` - Application entry point (not `index.js`)

### TypeScript Standards
- All new code should be written in TypeScript (`.ts` files)
- JavaScript (`.js`) files in the `/src` directory should be converted to TypeScript when modified
- Compiled JavaScript output should go to a `/dist` or `/build` directory (not in `/src`)

Documentation and planning artifacts should remain in the `/project-planning` directory.

## Remaining Tasks Prioritization

Based on our review of the current status and the completion of the MockArchitect sprint, we have prioritized the remaining tasks as follows:

### Priority 1: Complete Core Controller Tests with MockArchitect

1. **Create Achievement Controller Tests**
   - Use the MockArchitect system to create direct controller tests
   - Focus on testing the controller methods in isolation
   - Mock the Achievement model using ModelMock
   - Test both success and error cases
   - Target file: `/src/__tests__/controllers/achievement.controller.test.ts`

2. **Create Stress Management Controller Tests**
   - Implement direct controller tests for existing stress management functionality
   - Use the MockArchitect system to mock dependencies
   - Focus on testing the core functionality first
   - Target file: `/src/__tests__/controllers/stress-management.controller.test.ts`

### Priority 2: Implement Remaining High-Priority Features

1. **Session Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Implement the feature with TDD approach using MockArchitect
   - Create controller tests first, then implement the feature
   - Focus on core functionality before adding advanced features
   - Target files:
     - `/src/__tests__/controllers/meditation-session.controller.test.ts` (update)
     - `/src/controllers/meditation-session.controller.ts` (update)

2. **StressManagementSession Model**
   - Implement the model with proper validation
   - Create model tests using the in-memory MongoDB approach
   - Ensure proper TypeScript typing
   - Target files:
     - `/src/models/stress-management-session.model.ts`
     - `/src/__tests__/models/stress-management-session.model.test.ts`

### Priority 3: Create API Endpoint Tests

1. **Achievement API Endpoint Tests**
   - Use the MockArchitect system to mock controllers and middleware
   - Focus on testing the API contract rather than implementation details
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Target file: `/src/__tests__/routes/achievement.routes.test.ts`

2. **Stress Management API Endpoint Tests**
   - Implement tests for existing endpoints
   - Use the MockArchitect system for consistent mocking
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Target file: `/src/__tests__/routes/stress.routes.test.ts`

### Priority 4: Update Documentation

1. **Update Coding Standards**
   - Add error handling guidelines based on lessons learned
   - Include examples of proper error handling patterns
   - Reference the MockArchitect system for testing
   - Target file: `/project-planning/standards/coding-standards.md`

2. **Update Implementation Status**
   - Add test status information for all implemented features
   - Include links to test files and tracking issues
   - Document any known issues or limitations
   - Target file: `/project-planning/workflows/implementation-status.md`

### Implementation Approach

To ensure we're applying the MockArchitect system effectively without adding unnecessary complexity, we should follow these guidelines:

1. **Pragmatic Testing**
   - Focus on tests that provide the most value (critical paths, error handling)
   - Use direct controller tests for complex logic, API tests for contract validation
   - Avoid duplicating tests at multiple levels unnecessarily

2. **MockArchitect Integration**
   - Start with basic usage of RequestMock and ResponseMock
   - Gradually adopt more advanced features as the team becomes comfortable
   - Document patterns with examples for the team

3. **Migration Strategy**
   - Apply MockArchitect to all new tests
   - Migrate tests for critical functionality next
   - Update other tests when making changes to related code

### Test Implementation Strategy
1. Focus on unit tests for models first (highest priority)
2. Implement direct controller tests using the MockArchitect system
3. Create integration tests for API endpoints
4. Ensure all new code follows the "tests first" approach going forward
5. Use the appropriate mock classes from the MockArchitect system for each test type

### MockArchitect Integration

To improve our testing approach, we will integrate the MockArchitect system developed in the MockArchitect sprint:

1. **Controller Tests**
   - Use `createControllerTestEnv()` to set up the test environment
   - Mock model methods using `ModelMock`
   - Test controller methods directly
   - Assert on response status and data

2. **Middleware Tests**
   - Use `MiddlewareFactory` to create middleware mocks
   - Test middleware functions directly
   - Assert on request/response modifications

3. **Model Tests**
   - Continue using the in-memory MongoDB for model tests
   - Add tests for model methods and virtual properties

4. **API Route Tests**
   - Use `supertest` for API route testing
   - Mock authentication middleware using `AuthMiddlewareMock`
   - Test both success and error cases

5. **Migration Strategy**
   - Start with new tests for the meditation session controller
   - Gradually migrate existing tests to use the MockArchitect system
   - Document patterns and best practices

### AI Agent Testing Capabilities

To optimize development workflow while ensuring proper test coverage, we've established the following guidelines for AI agent testing:

1. **Targeted Testing (AI Agent)**
   - The AI agent can and should run targeted tests during development
   - Appropriate scopes include:
     - Single controller tests (e.g., `achievement.controller.test.ts`)
     - Specific feature tests (e.g., tests related to user achievements)
     - Small sets of related components (e.g., a model and its associated controller)
   - This enables rapid validation of changes without excessive computational overhead

2. **Comprehensive Testing (Human Developer)**
   - Full test suite runs should be initiated by human developers
   - The Human In the Loop (HIL) process should be followed for comprehensive testing
   - Human judgment is required for proper interpretation of complex test results
   - This approach ensures thorough validation while preventing unnecessary resource usage

3. **Test Writing and Fixing (Collaborative)**
   - The AI agent can assist with writing tests and suggesting fixes
   - Human developers should review and approve test implementations
   - The AI agent can help debug failing tests by analyzing error messages and suggesting solutions
   - This collaborative approach leverages the strengths of both AI and human developers

### Backend Tasks
- [x] Create TypeScript migration plan for remaining JavaScript files
  - [x] Create migration plan document
  - [x] Identify all JavaScript files to be migrated
  - [x] Prioritize files for migration
  - [x] Remove duplicate JavaScript files
