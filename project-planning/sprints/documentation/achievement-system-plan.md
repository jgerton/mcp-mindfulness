# Achievement System Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Achievement System is a core feature that will track user progress and reward engagement with both mindfulness and stress management practices. This document outlines the implementation plan for Sprint Three.

## Current Status

- 25 skipped tests documented in [Achievement Tests Documentation](../../testing/documentation/achievement-tests-documentation.md)
- Achievement system marked as "Can be extended with additional features" in the Implementation Status document
- Tracking issue created for achievement system tests

## Implementation Goals

### Core Achievement System

1. **Achievement Model**
   - Create schema with the following fields:
     - `name`: String (required)
     - `description`: String (required)
     - `category`: Enum ['meditation', 'stress', 'combined']
     - `criteria`: Object (requirements to earn)
     - `points`: Number (reward value)
     - `icon`: String (path to icon)
     - `isHidden`: Boolean (secret achievements)
     - `createdAt`: Date
     - `updatedAt`: Date

2. **User Achievement Tracking**
   - Create schema for tracking user progress:
     - `userId`: ObjectId (reference to User)
     - `achievementId`: ObjectId (reference to Achievement)
     - `progress`: Number (current progress)
     - `isCompleted`: Boolean
     - `completedAt`: Date (optional)
     - `progressHistory`: Array (track progress over time)

3. **Achievement Service**
   - Implement core service with methods:
     - `checkAchievementProgress(userId, action, metadata)`
     - `updateAchievementProgress(userId, achievementId, progress)`
     - `completeAchievement(userId, achievementId)`
     - `getAchievements(userId, filters)`

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Create the following endpoints:
     - `GET /api/achievements` - List all achievements
     - `GET /api/achievements/:id` - Get specific achievement
     - `GET /api/users/:userId/achievements` - Get user's achievements
     - `GET /api/users/:userId/achievements/progress` - Get progress

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Model and Schema (Days 1-2)
- Implement Achievement model
- Implement UserAchievement model
- Create database indexes
- Write unit tests for models

### Phase 2: Achievement Service (Days 3-5)
- Implement achievement service
- Create achievement processing pipeline
- Implement progress tracking
- Write unit tests for service

### Phase 3: API Endpoints (Days 6-8)
- Implement API controllers
- Create API routes
- Implement authorization checks
- Write integration tests for API

### Phase 4: Integration (Days 9-10)
- Connect achievement system to user activities
- Implement achievement triggers
- Create initial achievement set
- Write end-to-end tests

## Technical Specifications

### Achievement Criteria Structure
```typescript
interface AchievementCriteria {
  type: 'count' | 'duration' | 'streak' | 'milestone';
  target: number;
  activity?: string;
  conditions?: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
}
```

### Achievement Processing Pipeline
1. User performs an activity
2. Activity is logged to the system
3. Achievement service processes the activity
4. Service checks all relevant achievements
5. Progress is updated for matching achievements
6. Completed achievements trigger notifications

### Achievement Categories
1. **Meditation Achievements**
   - Session count milestones
   - Total duration milestones
   - Streak achievements
   - Technique variety achievements

2. **Stress Management Achievements**
   - Assessment completion
   - Stress reduction milestones
   - Technique usage
   - Trigger identification

3. **Combined Wellness Achievements**
   - Overall engagement
   - Balance between practices
   - Progress over time
   - Special challenges

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Model validation
- Service method functionality
- Progress calculation
- Achievement completion logic

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint functionality
- Authorization checks
- Error handling
- Database interactions

### End-to-End Tests
- Achievement triggering from user activities
- Progress tracking across sessions
- Achievement completion flow
- Notification system

## Dependencies

- User model
- Authentication system
- Session tracking
- Notification system

## Success Criteria

- All 25 skipped achievement tests passing
- Achievement system fully integrated with user activities
- API endpoints functional and secure
- Initial set of achievements available to users

## Future Enhancements (Post-Sprint)

- Achievement badges and visual rewards
- Social sharing of achievements
- Achievement leaderboards
- Time-limited special achievements
- Achievement-based recommendations
