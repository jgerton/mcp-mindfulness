# Test Implementation Plan for Sprint Two

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing test improvements and addressing skipped tests during Sprint Two. The plan is based on the lessons learned from Sprint One and the analysis of the 37 skipped tests in the codebase.

## Goals

- Document all skipped tests with standardized comments
- Create tracking issues for achievement system tests and meditation session tests
- Update testing standards with lessons learned from Sprint One
- Establish a test review schedule and implementation roadmap

## Test Documentation Standards

### Skipped Test Documentation Format

All skipped tests should be documented using the following format:

```typescript
// SKIPPED: [Reason for skipping]
// Description: [Brief description of what the test is checking]
// Requirements: [What needs to be implemented before this test can be unskipped]
// Related Issue: [Link to tracking issue]
// Target Date: [Expected date when this test should be unskipped]
it.skip('should [test description]', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Example

```typescript
// SKIPPED: Achievement system not fully implemented
// Description: Verifies that completing a meditation session awards the correct achievement
// Requirements: Achievement service needs to implement the checkAndAwardAchievements method
// Related Issue: #123 - Implement achievement system
// Target Date: End of Sprint Three
it.skip('should award achievement when meditation session is completed', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

## Achievement System Tests

### Current Status

- 25 skipped tests related to the achievement system
- Achievement system is marked as "Can be extended with" in the implementation status document
- Tests provide valuable documentation of intended behavior

### Implementation Plan

1. **Documentation Phase (Sprint Two)**
   - Document all 25 tests with standardized comments
   - Create a tracking issue with all tests listed
   - Update implementation status document

2. **Implementation Phase (Sprint Three)**
   - Implement core achievement system functionality
   - Unskip and fix basic achievement tests
   - Update tracking issue with progress

3. **Extension Phase (Sprint Four)**
   - Implement advanced achievement features
   - Unskip and fix remaining achievement tests
   - Close tracking issue when all tests pass

## Meditation Session Tests

### Current Status

- 12 skipped tests related to the meditation session model
- Meditation features are marked as "in progress" in the implementation status document
- Tests are for features that are planned but not yet fully implemented

### Implementation Plan

1. **Documentation Phase (Sprint Two)**
   - Document all 12 tests with standardized comments
   - Create a tracking issue with all tests listed
   - Update implementation status document

2. **Implementation Phase (Sprint Two/Three)**
   - Complete implementation of meditation session features
   - Unskip and fix meditation session tests
   - Update tracking issue with progress

3. **Validation Phase (Sprint Three)**
   - Ensure all meditation session tests pass
   - Close tracking issue when all tests pass
   - Update documentation with implementation details

## Testing Standards Updates

Based on lessons learned from Sprint One, the following updates to testing standards will be implemented:

### Error Response Consistency

- Add section on standardized error response format
- Document that all API error responses should use an `error` property
- Provide examples of proper error handling

### Authentication Token Structure

- Document required token structure for tests
- Specify that all test tokens should include `_id` and `username` properties
- Provide examples of proper authentication testing

### Authorization Checks

- Add guidance on ownership verification tests
- Document that all resource access should include authorization checks
- Provide examples of proper authorization testing

### MongoDB Connection Management

- Enhance database handling section
- Document proper connection management with in-memory MongoDB
- Provide examples of proper database setup and teardown

### ObjectId Validation

- Add guidance on handling MongoDB ObjectId validation
- Document proper validation techniques
- Provide examples of proper ObjectId handling

### Error Status Code Standardization

- Document standard HTTP status codes for common error scenarios
- Provide mapping of error types to status codes
- Include examples of proper status code usage

## Test Review Schedule

A quarterly review schedule for skipped tests will be established:

1. **End of Each Sprint**
   - Review progress on test implementation
   - Update tracking issues with current status
   - Adjust implementation plan as needed

2. **Monthly Review**
   - Comprehensive review of all skipped tests
   - Prioritize tests for implementation in next sprint
   - Update documentation with current status

3. **Quarterly Review**
   - Full audit of all tests (skipped and active)
   - Update test implementation roadmap
   - Adjust testing standards as needed

## Timeline

### Week 1 (Sprint Two)

- Create test documentation template
- Document achievement system tests
- Document meditation session tests
- Create tracking issues

### Week 2 (Sprint Two)

- Update testing standards document
- Create test review schedule
- Create test implementation roadmap
- Update implementation status document

### Sprints Three and Four

- Implement achievement system tests
- Complete meditation session tests
- Close tracking issues when tests pass

## Success Criteria

- All 37 skipped tests are properly documented
- Tracking issues are created and linked to documentation
- Testing standards document is updated with lessons learned
- Test review schedule and implementation roadmap are established
