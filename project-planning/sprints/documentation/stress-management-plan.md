# Stress Management Integration Plan

## Overview

The Stress Management functionality is a key component of our platform that complements the existing mindfulness practices. This document outlines the plan for beginning the integration of stress management features during Sprint Three.

## Current Status

- Stress management features are currently not implemented
- Mindfulness features are partially implemented
- Backend infrastructure is in place for extending with new features
- Documentation for stress management requirements exists in the backend feature review

## Implementation Goals

### Core Stress Management Models

1. **Stress Assessment Model**
   - Create schema with the following fields:
     - `userId`: ObjectId (reference to User)
     - `timestamp`: Date (required)
     - `stressLevel`: Number (1-10 scale)
     - `triggers`: Array of Strings
     - `physicalSymptoms`: Array of Strings
     - `emotionalState`: Array of Strings
     - `notes`: String
     - `createdAt`: Date
     - `updatedAt`: Date

2. **Stress Management Session Model**
   - Extend from base session interface:
     - `userId`: ObjectId (reference to User)
     - `timestamp`: Date (required)
     - `technique`: String (technique used)
     - `duration`: Number (minutes)
     - `effectivenessRating`: Number (1-10 scale)
     - `preStressLevel`: Number (1-10 scale)
     - `postStressLevel`: Number (1-10 scale)
     - `notes`: String
     - `createdAt`: Date
     - `updatedAt`: Date

3. **Stress Trigger Model**
   - Create schema for tracking common triggers:
     - `name`: String (required)
     - `category`: String (work, relationships, health, etc.)
     - `description`: String
     - `commonSymptoms`: Array of Strings
     - `suggestedTechniques`: Array of Strings
     - `createdAt`: Date
     - `updatedAt`: Date

## API Endpoints

1. **Stress Assessment Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/stress/assessment` - Create new assessment
   - `GET /api/stress/assessment/history` - Get assessment history
   - `GET /api/stress/assessment/trends` - Get stress level trends

2. **Stress Management Session Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/stress/sessions` - Create new session
   - `GET /api/stress/sessions/history` - Get session history
   - `GET /api/stress/techniques` - Get available techniques

3. **Stress Trigger Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/stress/triggers` - Get common triggers
   - `GET /api/stress/triggers/:id` - Get specific trigger
   - `GET /api/stress/triggers/user` - Get user's common triggers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Base Models and Schemas (Days 1-3)
- Create base session interface for shared functionality
- Implement StressAssessment model
- Implement StressManagementSession model
- Create database indexes
- Write unit tests for models

### Phase 2: Controllers and Services (Days 4-6)
- Create base session controller for shared logic
- Implement StressAssessmentController
- Implement StressManagementController
- Write unit tests for controllers

### Phase 3: API Endpoints (Days 7-9)
- Implement API routes for stress assessment
- Implement API routes for stress management sessions
- Implement API routes for stress triggers
- Write integration tests for API

### Phase 4: Integration with Existing Features (Days 10-12)
- Extend User model for stress preferences
- Modify Progress model for dual tracking
- Update Achievement system to include stress management
- Write end-to-end tests

## Technical Specifications

### Stress Level Scale
- 1-3: Low stress (manageable)
- 4-6: Moderate stress (concerning)
- 7-10: High stress (requires immediate attention)

### Stress Management Techniques
1. **Breathing Exercises**
   - Deep breathing
   - Box breathing
   - 4-7-8 technique

2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**
   - Full body PMR
   - Quick tension release
   - Focused area relaxation

3. **Guided Visualization**
   - Safe place visualization
   - Nature scenes
   - Goal visualization

4. **Physical Activities**
   - Walking
   - Stretching
   - Quick exercises

### Integration Points with Mindfulness

1. **Shared User Profile**
   - Stress baseline
   - Preferred techniques
   - Progress tracking

2. **Combined Analytics**
   - Stress-meditation correlation
   - Effectiveness comparison
   - Trend analysis

3. **Unified Dashboard**
   - Stress levels
   - Meditation progress
   - Combined wellness score

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Model validation
- Controller method functionality
- Service method functionality
- Data processing logic

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint functionality
- Authorization checks
- Error handling
- Database interactions

### End-to-End Tests
