# Frontend Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the frontend development plan across Sprints Four, Five, and Six. The plan is structured to first establish a solid design system and component foundation, then implement feature-specific interfaces, and finally refine and optimize the user experience.

## Current Status

- Project structure is set up
- Basic routing is in place
- Authentication UI is implemented
- Core components library is established
- Meditation timer component is in progress
- User profile interface is in progress

## Implementation Goals

### Sprint Four: UI Design System and Foundation
- Establish design system with tokens and guidelines
- Create core component library
- Implement application shell and navigation
- Develop design documentation

### Sprint Five: Feature-Specific UI Implementation
- Create user dashboard with widgets
- Implement meditation interface components
- Develop stress management interface
- Integrate with backend API endpoints

### Sprint Six: UI Refinement and Advanced Features
- Refine interfaces based on testing feedback
- Implement advanced UI features
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Enhance accessibility and performance

## Technical Specifications

### Component Architecture

```typescript
// Base component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Common props
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = (props) => {
  // Component logic
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};
```

### State Management

- Use React Context for global state
- Implement custom hooks for feature-specific state
- Use React Query for API data fetching and caching
- Implement form state with React Hook Form

### Styling Approach

- Use TailwindCSS for utility-based styling
- Create component-specific styles when needed
- Implement dark/light theme support
- Use CSS variables for theming

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  - Small: 640px
  - Medium: 768px
  - Large: 1024px
  - XL: 1280px
- Flexible layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering
- State management
- User interactions
- Conditional rendering

### Integration Tests
- Component integration
- Form submissions
- API interactions
- Navigation flows

### End-to-End Tests
- User journeys
- Authentication flows
- Feature completion
- Error handling

## Dependencies

- Next.js 15
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React Hook Form
- React Query
- shadcn/ui components

## Implementation Timeline

### Sprint Four (April 16-30, 2025)
- Week 1: Design system and core components
- Week 2: Application shell and documentation

### Sprint Five (May 1-15, 2025)
- Week 1: Dashboard and meditation interface
- Week 2: Stress management interface and API integration

### Sprint Six (May 16-30, 2025)
- Week 1: UI refinement and mobile optimization
- Week 2: Advanced features and accessibility

## Success Criteria

### Sprint Four
- Design system fully documented and implemented
- Core component library created and tested
- Application shell with navigation implemented
- Authentication UI flows completed

### Sprint Five
- User dashboard implemented with core widgets
- Meditation timer fully functional
- Stress assessment form implemented
- API integration completed for core features

### Sprint Six
- User interfaces refined based on feedback
- Mobile optimization completed
- Accessibility compliance achieved
- Advanced UI features implemented

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **Design System Complexity**
   - Risk: Creating an overly complex design system that slows development
   - Mitigation: Focus on essential components first, iterate based on needs

2. **API Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Backend API changes affecting frontend implementation
   - Mitigation: Use TypeScript interfaces, implement adapter pattern

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Complex UI components causing performance problems
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing, code splitting, lazy loading

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Risk: Inconsistent behavior across browsers
   - Mitigation: Cross-browser testing, polyfills, progressive enhancement

## Future Considerations

- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Native mobile app development
- Advanced data visualizations
- Internationalization
- Accessibility beyond WCAG AA compliance
- Performance optimization for low-end devices
