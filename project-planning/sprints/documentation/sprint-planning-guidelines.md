# Sprint Planning Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the guidelines for planning sprints in the MCP Mindfulness project, with specific focus on how to incorporate testing principles and lessons learned from previous sprints. These guidelines ensure consistency in our sprint planning process and help maintain high quality standards across all development activities.

## Sprint Structure

### Sprint Duration
- Each sprint lasts 2 weeks
- Sprint planning occurs on the first day of the sprint
- Sprint review and retrospective occur on the last day of the sprint

### Sprint Documentation
- Each sprint must have a dedicated sprint planning document
- The document should follow the established template in `sprints/sprint-template.md`
- All sprint-specific documentation should be stored in the `sprints/documentation/` directory

## Testing Principles Integration

### Core Testing Principles

The following core testing principles from `TODO-TESTING.md` must be incorporated into all future sprints:

1. **Error Response Consistency**
   - All API endpoints must follow standardized error response format
   - Error responses should use an `error` property for the error message
   - Status codes must be consistent (404 for not found, 400 for validation errors, etc.)

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - All authentication tokens must include both `_id` and `username` properties
   - All resource access must include ownership verification
   - Tests must verify both successful authentication and failure cases

3. **MongoDB Best Practices**
   - All controllers must validate ObjectId format before database operations
   - All tests must use proper connection management with in-memory MongoDB
   - Tests must include cases for invalid ObjectId formats

4. **Test Lifecycle Management**
   - All skipped tests must have clear documentation explaining why they're skipped
   - Tracking issues must be created for revisiting skipped tests
   - Regular reviews of skipped tests must be scheduled

### Integration Process

When planning each sprint, follow these steps to ensure testing principles are incorporated:

1. **Review Testing Documentation**
   - Review `testing/TODO-TESTING.md` and `sprints/sprint-three-testing-integration.md`
   - Identify any principles that apply to the features being developed in the sprint

2. **Include Testing Tasks**
   - Add a dedicated "Testing" section to the sprint backlog
   - Include specific tasks for implementing tests following the established principles
   - Assign at least one team member to focus on testing standards compliance

3. **Define Success Criteria**
   - Include testing-related success criteria in the sprint review criteria
   - Ensure all new features have comprehensive tests following the established principles
   - Require documentation for any new skipped tests

## Backend Development Guidelines

### Feature Implementation

When implementing backend features:

1. **API Endpoint Development**
   - Follow the error response consistency principles
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
   - Validate all input data, including ObjectId formats
   - Include comprehensive error handling

2. **Model Development**
   - Include validation for all model fields
   - Implement proper error handling for database operations
   - Follow established naming conventions

3. **Service Development**
   - Implement proper error handling and propagation
   - Follow the single responsibility principle
   - Include comprehensive unit tests

### Testing Requirements

All backend features must include:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test all service methods
   - Test model validation
   - Test utility functions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test API endpoints with authentication
   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Test database operations

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test invalid input data
   - Test unauthorized access
   - Test not found scenarios
   - Test validation errors

## Frontend Development Guidelines

### Component Development

When developing frontend components:

1. **Component Dependencies**
   - Follow the component dependency map in `sprints/documentation/ui-component-dependencies.md`
   - Implement components in the correct order based on dependencies
   - Document any new dependencies

2. **API Integration**
   - Handle API errors consistently
   - Implement proper authentication token management
   - Follow the established error handling patterns

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Include unit tests for all components
   - Test error handling and loading states
   - Test user interactions

## Documentation Requirements

Each sprint must include:

1. **Feature Documentation**
   - Document all new features and APIs
   - Update existing documentation as needed
   - Include examples of usage

2. **Testing Documentation**
   - Document all new tests
   - Update test documentation for modified features
   - Document any skipped tests with clear explanations

3. **Sprint Review**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Identify areas for improvement
   - Update these guidelines as needed

## Continuous Improvement

These guidelines should be reviewed and updated at the end of each sprint based on lessons learned. The goal is to continuously improve our development process and ensure that the principles from `TODO-TESTING.md` are fully integrated into our workflow.
