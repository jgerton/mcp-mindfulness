## Lessons Learned

### 1. Error Response Consistency

**Issue:** Inconsistencies in error response formats (using `message` vs `error` properties)

**Solution:** Standardized all API error responses to follow a consistent format with an `error` property containing the error message.

**Implementation:**
- Added "API Error Response Standards" section to testing-standards.md
- Added "API Error Handling Standards" section to coding-standards.md
- Created example controller with proper error handling

**Benefits:**
- Consistent error handling across the application
- Improved client-side error handling
- Easier testing of error scenarios

### 2. Authentication Token Structure

**Issue:** Tests were failing due to inconsistent token structure in test cases

**Solution:** Standardized all test tokens to include both `_id` and `username` properties to match production requirements.

**Implementation:**
- Added authentication token structure standards to coding-standards.md
- Added "Authentication & Authorization Testing" section to testing-standards.md
- Created example test with proper authentication

**Benefits:**
- Consistent authentication across the application
- Reduced authentication-related test failures
- Improved security by ensuring proper token validation

### 3. Authorization Checks

**Issue:** Missing proper authorization checks to prevent access to another user's resources

**Solution:** Added explicit guidance that all resource access should include ownership verification tests.

**Implementation:**
- Added authorization check requirements to backend-feature-review.md
- Added authorization testing guidance to testing-standards.md
- Updated example controller with proper authorization checks

**Benefits:**
- Improved security by preventing unauthorized access
- Consistent authorization checks across the application
- Better test coverage for security scenarios

### 4. MongoDB Connection Management

**Issue:** Connection issues were causing test failures

**Solution:** Enhanced database handling guidance to emphasize proper connection management using the in-memory MongoDB server.

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced "Database Handling" section in testing-standards.md
- Created example MongoDB test with proper connection management
- Added database connection management guidance to work-flow.md

**Benefits:**
- Reduced test failures due to connection issues
- Improved test performance with proper connection reuse
- Consistent database handling across tests

### 5. ObjectId Validation

**Issue:** Several tests failed due to improper ObjectId validation

**Solution:** Added specific guidance on handling MongoDB ObjectId validation in controllers and tests.

**Implementation:**
- Added ObjectId validation guidance to coding-standards.md
- Updated example controller with proper ObjectId validation
- Added validation examples to testing-standards.md

**Benefits:**
- Reduced validation-related errors
- Improved error messages for invalid IDs
- Consistent ID validation across the application

### 6. Test Lifecycle Management

**Issue:** Skipped tests lacked proper documentation and tracking

**Solution:** Established a standardized process for documenting, tracking, and reviewing skipped tests.

**Implementation:**
- Created Test Documentation Template
- Added "Test Lifecycle Management" section to testing-standards.md
- Created Test Review Schedule
- Created Test Implementation Roadmap

**Benefits:**
- Clear visibility into skipped tests
- Structured approach to test implementation
- Regular review process to ensure tests are implemented
