# Meditation Session Tests Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and implementation for the Meditation Session functionality in the MCP Mindfulness application. The tests cover various aspects of meditation sessions, including session creation, completion, analytics, and integration with other components.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests
- **`meditation-session.service.test.ts`**: Tests for the MeditationSessionService class
  - Tests session creation, completion, and retrieval
  - Validates error handling for invalid inputs
  - Ensures proper session state management

### Analytics Tests
- **`meditation-session.analytics.test.ts`**: Tests for meditation session analytics
  - Time of day pattern analysis
  - Duration trend analysis
  - Session grouping and aggregation

### Integration Tests
- **`session-analytics.integration.test.ts`**: End-to-end tests for session analytics
  - API endpoint testing
  - Data flow between components
  - Authentication and authorization

## Test Coverage

### Core Functionality
- **Session Creation**: Tests verify that new meditation sessions can be created with proper initial state
- **Session Completion**: Tests ensure sessions can be completed with appropriate metadata
- **Active Session Retrieval**: Tests confirm that active sessions can be retrieved for a user
- **Interruption Handling**: Tests validate that session interruptions are properly recorded

### Analytics Functionality
- **Time Analysis**: Tests for grouping sessions by time of day
- **Duration Analysis**: Tests for analyzing session duration patterns
- **Mood Improvement**: Tests for calculating mood improvement statistics
- **User Statistics**: Tests for calculating overall user meditation statistics

## Implementation Details

### Test Setup
- Each test suite uses an in-memory MongoDB database
- Test data is created before each test and cleaned up afterward
- Authentication tokens are generated for API tests

### Mock Data
- Test users with predefined IDs
- Test meditation sessions with various durations and completion states
- Test analytics data with mood states and focus scores

### Assertions
- Verification of session properties after creation/completion
- Validation of analytics calculations
- Confirmation of API response structures and status codes

## Running the Tests
```bash
# Run all meditation session tests
npx jest src/__tests__/meditation-session.service.test.ts src/__tests__/meditation-session.analytics.test.ts

# Run session analytics tests
npx jest src/__tests__/session-analytics.service.test.ts

# Run integration tests
npx jest src/__tests__/session-analytics.integration.test.ts
```

## Future Test Improvements
- Add performance testing for analytics queries
- Expand test coverage for edge cases
- Add stress tests for concurrent session handling
- Implement E2E tests with simulated user interactions
