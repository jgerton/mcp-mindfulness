# Document Grounding Plan

[← Back to Main README](../README.md)

## What is Document Grounding?

Document grounding refers to how we organize, manage, and connect our platform's content and documentation in a meaningful way. Think of it as creating a solid foundation for all our content - from meditation guides to technical documentation - ensuring it's:
- Easy to find and access
- Properly structured and categorized
- Securely stored and managed
- Effectively searchable
- Connected to related content

This plan is crucial because it helps us:
- Maintain consistency across all platform content
- Ensure users and developers can find what they need quickly
- Keep our content secure and properly versioned
- Scale our content management as the platform grows
