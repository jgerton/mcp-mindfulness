# Architecture Plan

[← Back to Main README](../README.md)

## What is Software Architecture?

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of our software system and the discipline of creating such structures. Think of it as the blueprint of our platform that defines:
- How different components work together
- How data flows through the system
- How the system scales and performs
- How we maintain security and reliability

This plan is crucial because it helps us:
- Build a scalable and maintainable system
- Make informed technical decisions
- Ensure system reliability and performance
- Guide future development and improvements

## System Overview

MCP Stress Management and Mindfulness Practices Platform is built as a modern web application with a focus on delivering integrated wellness experiences through:
- Seamless switching between stress management and mindfulness features
- Unified data model for tracking both practices
- Shared authentication and authorization
- Integrated analytics and reporting

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js 15 for server-side rendering and static generation
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for dual-purpose styling themes
- shadcn/ui for consistent component library
- React Query for unified state management

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- MongoDB for practice data storage
- Redis for session caching
- JWT for secure authentication

### Infrastructure
- Vercel for reliable hosting
- MongoDB Atlas for scalable database
- Cloudinary for meditation and guidance media
- SendGrid for practice reminders and notifications

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Local development with hot reloading
- Development environment on Vercel

### Staging
- Automated deployments from main branch
- Full testing suite runs
- Performance monitoring

### Production
- Blue-green deployments
- Automated rollbacks
- CDN integration
- Monitoring and alerting

## Security Measures

- HTTPS everywhere
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Security headers
- Regular security audits
