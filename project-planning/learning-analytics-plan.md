# Learning Analytics Plan

[← Back to Main README](../README.md)

## What are Learning Analytics?

Learning analytics involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting data about learners and their contexts to understand and optimize learning experiences. In our platform, it encompasses:
- Tracking user progress and engagement
- Analyzing meditation and stress management patterns
- Identifying effective learning strategies
- Measuring wellness outcomes

This plan is crucial because it helps us:
- Personalize learning experiences
- Improve content effectiveness
- Support data-driven decisions
- Enhance user outcomes
