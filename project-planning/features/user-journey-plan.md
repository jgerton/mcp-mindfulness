# User Journey Plan

[← Back to Main README](../README.md)

## What is a User Journey?

A user journey maps out the complete experience a user has with our platform, from their first interaction to becoming a regular practitioner. It helps us understand:
- How users discover and start using our platform
- What motivates them to continue their practice
- Where they might face challenges or friction
- How they progress in their wellness journey

This plan is crucial because it helps us:
- Design intuitive user experiences
- Identify and remove pain points
- Create meaningful engagement opportunities
- Support users in achieving their wellness goals
