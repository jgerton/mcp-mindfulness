# Work Flow

[← Back to Main README](../README.md)

## What is Development Workflow?

Development workflow defines how we organize and manage our development process, from planning to deployment. In our context, it involves:
- Structuring development cycles
- Managing code changes
- Ensuring quality control
- Coordinating team collaboration

This plan is crucial because it helps us:
- Maintain development efficiency
- Ensure code quality
- Facilitate team coordination
- Deliver reliable updates

## Helpful Resources for New Team Members

- [Agile Development Practices](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)
- [Code Review Best Practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/)
- [Continuous Integration/Deployment](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)

## Sprint Structure

### Planning (Day 1)
- Review stress management and mindfulness backlog
- Balance feature priorities between practices
- Assign integrated tasks
- Estimate combined effort

### Development (Days 2-8)
- Daily standups covering both practice areas
- Parallel feature implementation
- Integrated code reviews
- Dual-focus documentation

### Review (Day 9)
- Combined feature demos
- Integration testing
- Cross-practice documentation review
- Holistic performance testing

### Retrospective (Day 10)
- Review achievements in both areas
- Assess practice integration
- Plan balanced improvements
- Update unified processes

## Development Process

### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch (stress/mindfulness/integrated)
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add integration points
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update dual-practice documentation
6. Create pull request
7. Merge to develop

### Bug Fixes
1. Create bug report
2. Reproduce issue
3. Create fix branch
4. Implement fix
5. Add regression tests
6. Create pull request
7. Merge to develop

## Release Strategy

### Pre-release
1. Version bump
2. Update changelog
3. Run test suite
4. Create release branch
5. Deploy to staging

### Release
1. Final testing
2. Create release tag
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor metrics
5. Document release

### Post-release
1. Monitor performance
2. Track errors
3. Gather feedback
4. Plan improvements

## Code Review Process

### Submitting
1. Complete implementation
2. Self-review changes
3. Update documentation
4. Create pull request
5. Request reviews

### Reviewing
1. Check code quality
2. Verify functionality
3. Review tests
4. Check documentation
5. Provide feedback

### Merging
1. Address feedback
2. Get approvals
3. Resolve conflicts
4. Merge changes
5. Delete branch
